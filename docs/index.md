### What is it?  
EasyAuth is a desktop application that helps you authenticate with a website or online service that uses two-factor authentication. EasyAuth stores the secret keys that websites provide when you enroll in two-factor authentication and then generates the one-time passcodes that you use to verify your identity.

### What's unique about it?  
It's quicker and less hassle than other 2FA methods or applications.
Since it's a desktop application it doesn't require a smartphone or a cell connection.
It doesn't require manually typing verification codes.
During setup of an account it scans QR codes for you. 

### How do I use it?  
* When logging into to a site you will be prompted for a verification code.
* From EasyAuth click on the passcode button to copy it to the clipboard.
* Paste the code into the verification form.


### Features
